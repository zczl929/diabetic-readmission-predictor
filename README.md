## Predicting Hospital Readmission Rates for Diabetic Patients

This project develops a machine learning system to predict hospital readmission rates for diabetic patients. Using data from 130 US hospitals (1999-2008), we built models to classify patient outcomes into three categories: readmission within 30 days, readmission after 30 days, or no readmission.
The implementation includes comprehensive feature engineering, handling of missing values, and addressing class imbalance issues. After evaluating multiple models, we found that XGBoost combined with Random Undersampling achieved the best performance.
The project demonstrates the potential of machine learning in supporting clinical decision-making while acknowledging the complexity of healthcare data.
